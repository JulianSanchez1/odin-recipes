  <h1>Crispy Buffalo Chicken Wings(Baked)</h1>

  <img src="/Users/julian/Desktop/odin-recipes/images/wings.jpeg">


  <h4>Description</h4>

  <p>This extremely popular creation came out of a New York restaurant in the 60’s by Teressa Bellissimo, who covered them in
  her own special sauce and served them with a side of celery and blue cheese. Since then, Buffalo wings have become the
  quintessential game day food in the United States served at bars, restaurants or ordered as take out.</p>
  <P><strong>Of COURSE</strong> this recipe includes serving them in a Blue Cheese Dressing or Ranch dressing.
  
  These wings were not only a hit at the dinner table, they were ordered again the next day! Just when I thought this
  little experiment wouldn’t be well received!

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Chicken Wings</li>
    <li>Aluminium free baking powder</li>
    <li>Seasoned baking powder</li>
    <li>Garlic Powder</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Pepper</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>Coating chicken wings in seasoned baking powder</li><br>
    <li>You’re going to pimp yours up with added flavours:<br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Garlic powder</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>You cana also add a ddash of Cayenne Pepper</li>
    </ul>
  
    <br><br>

    Toss them until they are coated evenly.</li><br>
    <li>After your chicken wings are coated, place aluminium foil on your baking sheet to catch any drippings, then arrange a
    wire rack over the top. Place your wings in an even layer to allow the heat to be evenly distributed.<br><br>
    
    You’re then going to bake your chicken wings on a rack so the fat can drip off, creating ultra crispy wings all over.
</li><br>
<li>Chicken wings can take about 50 minutes or more to bake, flipping them halfway through cooking time to allow even
crispness. Why so long? To allow the fat to render out from the chicken wings so that the skin crisps to a delicious
golden brown.</li>

  </ol>
